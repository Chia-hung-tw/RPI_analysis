This RPI code consists of 2 parts:
1. Ntuplizer: make .raw(and injection) file into root file
2. Analysis : use root file to do analysis / produce some plots, etc


The usage for Ntuplizer:

1. cd Ntuplizer
2. make
3. ls rawdata/targetfile.raw > runinfo.log
4. ./Ntuplizer
Output root file will be inside "root_out"
(Then one should move the root file to ../Analysis/root_data)

The Analysis part usage:
1. cd Analysis
2. make
3. ls root_data/targetfile.root > input.txt
4. ./makePlots
5. It will show a 1D histogram for time sample0 for chip 0 ch 20.
6. Then I fill some TH2Poly by a single event TS0.
7. The 3rd plot will be the pulse shape of certain event.

The main structure of root data:
1. I save a "hitcollection" in each event, which is defined in hit_hits_class.h
2. I also provide a pedestal calculation function ( makePlots::P_and_N ),
   which user can choose to output the calculation result or not.
3. One can also read pedestal back from other RUNs by pedestal function.
   (makePlots::read_P_and_N)
Please make use of them, I wrote the usage in makePlots.h
